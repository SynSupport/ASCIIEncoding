SUBMISSION NAME:        ASCIIEncoding.dbl

PLATFORM:               Windows, VMS, Unix

SYNERGY VERSION:        Synergy v9.1.5 or higher

MODIFICATION HISTORY:   November 13th, 2008 - Initial version
                        September 20th, 2010 - Added support for Synergy 9.5

DESCRIPTION:            ASCIIEncoding is a class that provides methods to represent an ASCII character
                        encoding of characters.

ADDITIONAL NOTES:       In order to use this class, it must first be prototyped with the DBLPROTO
                        utility.  Ensure that your SYNIMPDIR and SYNEXPDIR environment variables
                        have been set, then run the protyper by typing:

                                dblproto ASCIIEncoding

                        from a command prompt in the directory where the ASCIIEncoding.dbl file has
                        been saved. (Alternately, import the file into a Workbench project, right-
                        click the project in the Projects tab and select "Generate Synergy
                        Protypes..."). The included file can then be compiled and added to any
                        library or ELB.  To use the provided class methods, simply type

                                import SynPSG.Text.Encoding

                        at the top of your source code. (See Example, below).

CLASS:                  ASCIIEncoding     (Public)

ENUMERATION(S):
        None

CONSTRUCTOR:
        None

PROPERTIES:
        None

METHOD(S):
        GetBytes
                Encodes all the characters in the specified String into a sequence of bytes.

                Usage & Overloads

                ASCIIEncoding.GetBytes(string a_string), [#]@Byte
                        a_string is a string variable


EXAMPLE(S):

        The following program demonstrates the use of the ASCIIEncoding.GetBytes method.

;; Program to demonstrate the ASCIIEncoding.GetBytes method.

import SynPSG.Text.Encoding

main
record
        byteArray       ,[#]@Byte
        oldString       ,string
        wrkByte         ,@Byte
endrecord

proc
        open(1,O,'TT:')
        oldString = "This is a test."
        writes(1,"Original String:")
                writes(1,%atrim(oldString))
                writes(1,"")
        byteArray = ASCIIEncoding.GetBytes(oldString)
        writes(1,"Characters in original string: "+%string(byteArray.Length,'ZZX'))
        writes(1,"Values of each element in the returned byte array:")
        foreach wrkByte in byteArray
                writes(1,%string(wrkByte,'XXX')+"  ("+^a(wrkByte)+")")
end
